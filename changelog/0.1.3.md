# v0.1.3 — 2026-01-20

## Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the Hex color picker closed immediately when clicking or dragging inside it.
- Prevented the Escape key from closing the main popup while a color picker is open.
- Resolved interaction conflicts between Electron draggable regions and interactive color picker components.

## Improved
- Theme color customization is now stable and uninterrupted while adjusting colors.
- Improved usability of `react-colorful` popovers with proper focus handling.
- Cleaner and more predictable behavior when editing theme colors.

## Added
- Support for customizing additional theme colors:
  - Item text color
  - Item muted text color
  - Control text color
- Safer outside-click detection for closing color pickers intentionally.

## Internal
- Refactored color picker logic to isolate open/close state per component.
- Improved event propagation control (`stopPropagation`) to avoid accidental UI dismissal.
- Minor UI and state-handling cleanup for maintainability.
