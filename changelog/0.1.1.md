# v0.1.1 — 2026-01-14

## Fixed
- Stabilized clipboard history loading to prevent occasional missing/duplicate items after rapid copy actions.
- Improved persistence reliability to reduce cases where history did not refresh until reopening.

## Improved
- Better internal error handling around history retrieval and UI refresh.
- Minor UI alignment improvements in the popup list.

## Notes
- This release focused on stability only (no theme system, no language UI yet).
